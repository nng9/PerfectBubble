Baseline Goals:
- Be able to measure pressure
- Use a stepper motor controller by an MBed to inflate and deflate the balloon
- Implement a control algorithm that responds to changes in pressure and inflates or deflates the cuff to maintain pressure
- Build a good rig for testing

Reach Goals:
- Add a buzzer to the device that gives an alert to the physician when the pressure has fallen out of range
- Have buttons that correspond to manually moving the syringe
- Log data on pressure and send it to a computer via wifi for analysis.
