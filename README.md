# Week 1
Software Implementation: Interface piezo-resistor with MBed to light up an LED when pressed.

# Week 2
Software Implementation: Interface with motor driver to be able to move it clockwise, counterclockwise, and stop.

# Week 3
Software Implementation: Interface piezo-resistor with motor driver to rotate one direction when not pressed and one direction when pressed.

# Week 4
Software Implementation: Interface MBed with LCD to display the pressure reading, based on this reading, rotate the motor driver (now attached ot the syringe pump) clockwise or counterclockwise to push the syringe in or out.

Baseline Goals:
- Be able to measure pressure
- Use a stepper motor controller by an MBed to inflate and deflate the balloon
- Implement a control algorithm that responds to changes in pressure and inflates or deflates the cuff to maintain pressure
- Build a good rig for testing

Reach Goals:
- Add a buzzer to the device that gives an alert to the physician when the pressure has fallen out of range
- Have buttons that correspond to manually moving the syringe
- Log data on pressure and send it to a computer via wifi for analysis.
